# Next.js Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `next/link` component in Next.js applications. The links fail to navigate to the intended pages, which can be caused by misconfiguration or routing problems.  This example illustrates the problem and provides a working solution.

## Problem

The provided code includes two links using the `next/link` component. These links should navigate to the `/` and `/about` routes, respectively. However, in the initial code, they might not be functioning correctly.  This could manifest as no navigation, unexpected behavior, or even errors in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring correct usage of the `next/link` component and verifies the routes are properly defined within your Next.js application.  The solution file shows the corrected implementation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the links. The initial implementation will likely not function correctly.  The solution file provides the corrected code.
